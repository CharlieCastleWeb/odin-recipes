    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Place a large pot of salted water over high heat to bring to a boil. Pour tomatoes in a medium bowl and crush well with hands or chop in a food processor. Set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>While water heats, prepare the sauce. In a large saucepan or deep skillet, heat oil and pancetta over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring frequently until pancetta is crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring constantly, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until the tomato paste has taken on a slight brownish color, 2 to 3 minutes. Add vodka and cook until reduced by at least half. Stir in reserved tomatoes and juices and bring mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>While sauce reduces, add pasta to boiling water and cook, according to package directions until al dente, 11 to 12 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Once sauce is reduced, stir in heavy cream and pepper and cook for 3 minutes, stirring often. Stir in 1/3 cup cheese, parsley, basil and pasta until well combined. Season with additional salt and pepper if desired.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Serve, sprinkled with remaining cheese and more herbs if desired.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
